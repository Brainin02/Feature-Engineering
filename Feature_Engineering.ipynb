        "\n",
        "ans. Feature scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to standardize or normalize the range of independent variables or features in a dataset. Since many machine learning algorithms work better or converge faster when the features are on a similar scale, feature scaling ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model's performance.\n",

        "How Feature Scaling Helps in Machine Learning\n",
        "Improves Convergence in Gradient Descent:\n",
        "\n",
        "Many machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks, rely on gradient descent to minimize the loss function. If the features are on different scales, the gradient steps may become uneven, leading to a slow or unstable convergence. Scaling the features ensures that the gradient descent converges faster and more reliably.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prevents Bias Toward Larger Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "Algorithms that compute distances between data points, like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are sensitive to the scale of the features. Without scaling, features with larger values may dominate the distance calculation, leading to biased predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improves Performance of Distance-Based Algorithms:\n",
        "\n",
        "KNN, K-means clustering, and DBSCAN (density-based clustering) all rely on distance metrics like Euclidean distance. If the features are not scaled, the algorithm may place more importance on features with larger ranges, resulting in poor performance. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps with Regularization:\n",
        "\n",
        "In models like ridge regression or Lasso regression, regularization terms (penalties) are added to control the complexity of the model. These terms depend on the magnitudes of the feature coefficients. If features are not scaled, the model may penalize large-magnitude features more, even if they are not important, leading to biased results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improves Model Interpretability:\n",
        "\n",
        "After scaling, features are typically on the same scale, making it easier to compare their relative importance or interpret the model's coefficients in some cases.\n",
